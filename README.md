# Statistical Analysis with R

## Description
This repository contains code for various statistical experiments conducted using R. Each experiment is organized into its own directory and includes relevant documentation, datasets, and R code.


## Experiment-1.1
**Aim:** Apply R to calculate and visualize measures of central tendency (Arithmetic Mean, Median, Mode) for a given dataset.


## Experiment-1.2
**Aim:** Utilize R's visualization capabilities for the graphical representation of measures of dispersion, including Range, Quartile Deviation, Standard Deviation, and Variance, in a given dataset.



## Experiment-1.3
**Aim:** Employ R to use random number generation and simulations to verify theoretical probabilities.



## Experiment-1.4
**Aim:** Use R data frames to study and analyze real-world datasets, perform basic data manipulations, and generate descriptive statistics using R functions.



## Experiment-2.1
**Aim:** Perform a comprehensive regression analysis using R, exploring various methods such as linear regression, multiple regression, and polynomial regression.


## Experiment-2.2
**Aim:** Simulate and analyze discrete probability distributions, focusing on Bernoulli, Binomial, and Poisson distributions using R.



## Experiment-2.3
**Aim:** Visualize continuous probability distributions, specifically Uniform, Exponential, and Normal distributions, with a focus on the properties of the normal distribution and area under the normal curve using R.


## Experiment-3.1
**Aim:** Implement various sampling techniques in R and assess their impact on the accuracy of statistical parameter estimation.



## Experiment-3.2
**Aim:** Apply the procedures for testing hypotheses in R, including t-test, Z-test, and Chi-Square test, to analyze the significance of various scenarios.



## Experiment-3.3
**Aim:** Make use of One-way ANOVA and Two-way ANOVA techniques in R to explore the sources of variability among different groups.
